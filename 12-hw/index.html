                                        as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. 
                                        You can learn more about React in the next section. 
                                        But first, let&rsquo;s cover how components work in React Native.

                                        To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. 
                                        This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

                                        <li class="react-list-items"> <span class="react-list-headers">components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: 
                                                friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</li>
                                        <li class="react-list-items"><span class="react-list-headers">JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
                                                <span class="bcgrnd-clr">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;.</span> 
                                                The React docs have <span class="undrln">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to learn even more. 
                                                Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, 
                                                and embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="bcgrnd-clr">&lt;Text&gt;.</span></li>
                                        <li class="react-list-items"><span class="react-list-headers">props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </li>
                                        <li class="react-list-items"><span class="react-list-headers">state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like 
                                                a component&rsquo;s personal data storage. 
                                                State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. 
                                                State gives your components memory!</li>

                                        It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, 
                                        and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
